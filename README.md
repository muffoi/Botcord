> [!NOTE]
> Botcord is still in active development and lacks many essential features. These will be added over next months of development.

## Installing
- Download the latest standalone executable from [releases](https://github.com/muffoi/Botcord/releases) and run it anywhere you desire.
- Or, download the zip distributable, extract it and run the main executable in directory (the one with app icon).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you get a warning that the app cannot be opened, click "Run Anyways". You may need to click "more info" to see this option.
> This warning is entirely harmless and only shows because the app is not signed. Signing it would cost me [upwards of 300â‚¬/year](https://shop.certum.eu/data-security/code-signing-certificates/certum-ev-code-sigining.html).
